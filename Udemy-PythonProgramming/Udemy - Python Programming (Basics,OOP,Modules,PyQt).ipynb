    "- __What is Programming?__<br />\n",
    "    The process of developing and implementing variouse sets of instructions to envable a computer to do a certain task. These instructions are considered computer programs and help the computer to operate smoothly\n",
    "- __Two Types of Programming Languages__\n",
    "    - Low Level Languages\n",
    "        - The language of the computer\n",
    "        - It consists of 1,0\n",
    "        - It is easy to be Executed\n",
    "        - It is hard to programe\n",
    "        - Can run only of one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to another\n",
    "        - Like C, Assembly\n",
    "    - High Level Languages\n",
    "        - Easy to programe\n",
    "        - Takes less time to be coded\n",
    "        - Easy to be corrected\n",
    "        - Portable (only one programe can run on any pc)\n",
    "        - Like jave, c# & python\n",
    "- __Why Python__\n",
    "    - Easy to programe & easy to read\n",
    "    - Open source\n",
    "    - Play with other languages and easily extendible\n",
    "    - Cross Platform\n",
    "    - Fast\n",
    "    - Can use python for all fields\n",
    "    - Many Platforms\n",
    "#### Interpreter VS Compiler\n",
    "- __Overview:__\n",
    "    - The high level languages need to be Executed on the pc\n",
    "    - But computer understand only 1,0\n",
    "    - We need to transform the high level code to low level code so that computer can understand it\n",
    "- __Interpreter__\n",
    "    - The interpreter will transform the code from the first to the las word by word\n",
    "    - If interpreter find one error it will sto working raising this error\n",
    "    - Like Python\n",
    "- __Compiler__\n",
    "    - The compiler will transform the whole code\n",
    "    - If the compiler found any error it will continue and when it finish it will raise all the errors\n",
    "    - Like C#\n",
    "#### Python Variables\n",
    "- __What is a variable?__\n",
    "    - Variable: is a name that refers to a value\n",
    "    - Variable = variable name + variable value\n",
    "    - You can declare any value\n",
    "    - There is conditions to declare name !\n",
    "- __Conditions of declare a name__\n",
    "    - Can contain both letters and numbers\n",
    "    - Have to begin with letters\n",
    "    - You can use underscore character\n",
    "    - You can use uppercase letters\n",
    "    - Python are case sensitive\n",
    "- __Reserved Words:__\n",
    "    <img src=\"./img/Reserved Words.png\"/>\n",
    "- __Assigning Value to Variables__\n",
    "    - Single assignment:\n",
    "        - ex: x = 5\n",
    "        - ex: s = \"Welcome\"\n",
    "    - Multi assignment:\n",
    "        - ex: x,y = 5,3\n",
    "        - ex: a=b=c 1\n",
    "- __Variable Types__\n",
    "    1. __Int:__ is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.<br /> Example. Integers: x = 1 y = 35656222554887711 z = -3255522\n",
    "    2. __String:__ ontaining all ASCII characters that are considered whitespace. This includes the characters space, tab, linefeed, return, formfeed, ...\n",
    "    3. __Float:__ Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. For example, 97.98, 32.3+e18, -32.54e100 all are floating point numbers.\n",
    "    4. __Bool:__ represent one of two values: True or False\n",
    "    5. __List:__ Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. ex:\n",
    "        ```thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]```\n",
    "    6. __Dictionary:__\n",
    "        - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key: value pairs.\n",
    "        - A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        thisdict = {\n",
    "        \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "        \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "        \"year\": 1964\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    7. __Tuple:__\n",
    "        - Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "        - A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.\n",
    "        - Tuples are written with round brackets\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "- __Type Method:__\n",
    "    - You can use the type() method to know the type of the variable, ex:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    s = 'welcome'\n",
    "    type(x) => Class 'int'\n",
    "    type(s) => Class 'str'\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```"
